# cookbook
A recipe cookbook web application built with Flask as an example to show how to use Ankra to deploy a Python application to Kubernetes.
This repository does not contain any Kubernetes related files. The deployment files are generated by Ankra.

## Deployment using Ankra
The .ankra.yaml file contains the deployment configuration for the application. Ankra will use this file to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
